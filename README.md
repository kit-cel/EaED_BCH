# EaED_BCH

This repository accompanies the paper  
**"On the Error Rate of Binary BCH Codes under Error-and-Erasure Decoding"**.  

It provides MATLAB implementations for reproducing the numerical results presented in the paper.  

### Contents
- **`main.m`** – generates the results shown in Tables I and II.  
- **`code_255_5.m`** – generates the results for Fig. 2.  
- **`RS_BCH.m`** – generates the results for Fig. 3.  

### Notes
- The code is intended to ensure reproducibility of the published results.  
- All scripts are written in MATLAB.
